        <p class="text1">How to play: The toy is a classic arkanoid. 
        The rules are straightforward - 
        arm yourself with your mouse to move the platform at 
        the bottom of the screen. Hit the blocks on the screen 
        with a ball and try to put a platform under it in time 
        to direct it to the right place. Do not let the ball fly 
        by - as a result, you will lose one of your lives. The 
        game will only be completed when all the blocks on the 
        screen that can be destroyed are broken.</p><br>
